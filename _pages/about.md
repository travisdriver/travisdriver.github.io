I am currently pursuing a PhD in the [School of Aerospace Engineering](https://ae.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am a member of the [Dynamics and Control Systems Lab](http://dcsl.gatech.edu/), and I am being advised by [Professor Panagiotis Tsiotras](http://dcsl.gatech.edu/tsiotras.html). Before coming to Georgia Tech, I recieved by BS in [Computational Engineering](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/undergraduate/computational-undergrad-program) from The University of Texas at Austin with High Honors.
