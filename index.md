I am a Robotics PhD student in the [Dynamics and Control Systems Laboratory](http://dcsl.gatech.edu/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology being advised by [Professor Panagiotis Tsiotras](http://dcsl.gatech.edu/tsiotras.html). I received my BS in Computational Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin in 2019. 

My research interests include computer vision, 3D perception, and navigation with a specific interest in aerospace applications. For more information, see [my CV](https://travisdriver.github.io/docs/travisdriver_cv.pdf).
