I am currently a first-year PhD student in Aerospace Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am a member of the [Dynamics and Control Systems Laboratory](http://dcsl.gatech.edu/) being advised by [Professor Panagiotis Tsiotras](http://dcsl.gatech.edu/tsiotras.html). Before coming to Georgia Tech, I received my BS in Computational Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin with High Honors. For more information, see [my CV](https://travisdriver.github.io/docs/travisdriver_cv.pdf).
